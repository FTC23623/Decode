/*
This sample FTC OpMode uses methods of the Datalogger class to specify and
collect robot data to be logged in a CSV file, ready for download and charting.

For instructions, see the tutorial at the FTC Wiki:
https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Datalogging


The Datalogger class is suitable for FTC OnBot Java (OBJ) programmers.
Its methods can be made available for FTC Blocks, by creating myBlocks in OBJ.

Android Studio programmers can see instructions in the Datalogger class notes.
